# **Exercises**
## **Submit answers to the following questions:**

#### **1. In your own words, explain single-page applications and progressive web apps.**

Single Page Web Apps (SPA) are apps that literally only have one page. A SPA is super easy to display if compared to traditional server side rendered applications. It's really just one index.html file with a CSS Bundle and a JS Bundle. This type of deployment scales very well. 

On an SPA after the initial page load no more html gets sent over the network. Only data gets requested the server or sent to the server.

Examples of SPAs are 

www.google.com
www.gmail.com
google.maps.com

Progressive Web Apps (PWAS) are web applications that are regular web pages or websites but can appear to the user like traditional applications or native mobile applications. The applications type attempts to combine features offerred by most modern browsers with the benefits of a mobile experience. Currently Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and other companies are working on a new, modern web application standard. PWAS are installable and live on the user's home screen, w/o the need for an app store. PWAs could be the next big thing for the mobile web. They can act like an android or ios app but you won't need to have an android developer or ios developer to build and maintain it. You will only need one, a web developer.




#### **2. Either from your research or by inspecting popular sites you frequent (using the Chrome DevTools), give some real-world examples of applications built with React and Angular.**

###Websites built with React - A Javascript library for building user interfaces.

#### **3. Write a summary of the benefits of React vs. Angular.**

React JS is a library instead of a framework. Frameworks can be heavy handed and can limit you to doing tasks only one way whereas libraries are a tool that can be used to solve a problem ... you can use different tools in React to solve your problem different ways. In React you have much more control vs in Angular where Angular is dictating how things get done. One benefit of Angular is that it is supported by Google. New changes before they are rolled out must pass through testing of Google's own 600 apps using Angular JS to insure they are not introducing new bugs. Per my Mentor React is far and away the most popular choice and many more developer jobs are looking for React experience vs Angular experience. That said some very large projects are already using Angular and that in itself would be very costly if they decided to change and use React so many larger companies are sticking with Angular because the cost to change is too much to justify the change. Angular JS is very popular among the banking industry.
